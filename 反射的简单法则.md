## 原文标题为：The Laws of Reflection

### 简介

在计算机中，反射是一程序去检查自己结构、特殊的通过类型的能力。它来自于元编程，它也是一种混乱的根源。  

In this article we attempt to clarify things by explaining how reflection works in Go. Each language's reflection model is different (and many languages don't support it at all), but this article is about Go, so for the rest of this article the word "reflection" should be taken to mean "reflection in Go".
